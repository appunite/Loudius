# Loudius - Android experimental playground
This project serves as an example Android project and a playground for experimenting with new architectures, solutions, and libraries. Functionalities of the app are simple. It uses GithubAPI and let's user ping his collaborators for a faster code review. 

## Contributing
We believe that there is no ideal code and that every code can be improved. Therefore, we welcome every issue and new idea. We encourage you to open a new issue or pull request, as we can all learn from each other.

## Experiments
We have a dedicated folder called experiments Every experiment should be on a separate branch, and the branch should be named after the experiment. We ask that experimental branches not be merged into the develop branch. Instead, they serve as an experiment, and if someone wants to see how it looks, they should checkout the experimental branch.

### Rules for Experiments
We have a few rules for experiments to keep everything organized and consistent:

- Every experiment should be on a separate branch in the experiment folder.
- The branch should be named after the experiment.
- The experiment should not be merged into the develop branch.
- The experiment should have a clear purpose and goal.
- The experiment should not interfere with the stability of the existing codebase. 


### Example Experiment
Here's an example of an experiment that meets our rules:

Branch Name: experiment/user-profile-ui
Purpose: To experiment with different UI components for the user profile screen.
Goal: To improve the user experience and make the screen more visually appealing.
Method: Test different UI components and layouts on the screen and collect user feedback.
