# Loudius - Android experimental playground

This project serves as an example Android project and a playground for experimenting with new
architectures, solutions, and libraries. Functionalities of the app are simple. It uses GithubAPI
and let's user ping his collaborators for a faster code review.

## Contributing

We believe that there is no ideal code and that every code can be improved. Therefore, we welcome
every issue and new idea. We encourage you to open a new issue or pull request, as we can all learn
from each other.

## Experiments

Our project is designed for those who want to experiment with different solutions, architectures,
and libraries in the Android development world. We believe that experimenting is the key to
improving your skills and finding the best solutions for your needs.

We encourage everyone to join us and create their own experiments. You can experiment with anything
related to Android development - UI, performance, architecture, libraries, and more.

To create your own experiment, simply download our repository, create a new branch, and start
experimenting. Once you're done, create a pull request, and our community will review it. We believe
that by sharing our experiments with each other, we can all learn and improve.

We welcome all levels of experience in our community, whether you're a beginner or an expert. We're
all here to learn and grow together.

So come and join us in Loudius - Android experimental playground, and let's experiment together!

### Rules for Experiments

We have a few rules for experiments to keep everything organized and consistent:

- Every experiment should be on a separate branch in the experiment folder.
- The branch should be named after the experiment.
- The experiment should not be merged into the develop branch.
- The experiment should have a clear purpose and goal.
- The experiment should not interfere with the stability of the existing codebase.

### Example Experiment
Here's an example of an experiment that meets our rules:

Branch Name: experiment/navigation-by-voyager-library
Purpose: Check compose navigation with voyager library. Compare that with standard way.
Goal: To resolve which navigation is better for compose. What are the pros and cons of each way.
Method: Implement navigation with voyager library.
