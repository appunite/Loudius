## üßê Firebase Analytics

Google Analytics helps you see how people use your Android app. It automatically tracks different
actions and user details. You can even create your own custom events to measure things that are
important to your app. Once it collects this info, you can check it out on a dashboard in the
Firebase console.

|                     Users in last 30 minutes.                      |    ![Last 30 minutes](analytics_imgs/last_30_mins.png)    |
|              List of events from the selected period.              |   ![List of events](analytics_imgs/list_of_events.png)    |
| When you click on an event, you can see more detailed information. | ![Detailed information](analytics_imgs/detailed_info.png) |

### How to test?

First, you should add commands to terminal which allow you logging events.

```
$ adb shell setprop log.tag.FA VERBOSE
$ adb shell setprop log.tag.FA-SVC VERBOSE
$ adb logcat -v time -s FA FA-SVC
```

Last command will print logs for the device.
If you have problems with adb command, those links can

and [StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50456824/adb-command-not-found-on-mac-computer).
Then, you can open the app and start testing! You should be able to see relevant events in Logcat.

**‚ùóÔ∏èBe aware that you won't see analytics on dashboard immediately. Firebase needs about a few hours
to note it.‚ùóÔ∏è**
